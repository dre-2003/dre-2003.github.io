<p style="font-family:courier;font-size:150%;">Omo make i no lie you, its been so hard for me like since the time i started higher institution, tho all my basic necessities were catered adequately by my parents. 
But the hellic stress was killing me bruh. Especially when i was in ND2, that level was crazy man but alhamdullilah <strong>Allah</strong> guided and protected me through the course of my learning.<br><q>Allah the exalted says that with every hardship
comes ease</q></p>
